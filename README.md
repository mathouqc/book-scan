# book-scan
The aim of this library is to facilitate post-processing of large quantities of photos to digitalize books.

There are already applications like [Genius Scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thegrizzlylabs.geniusscan.free) or [IScanner](https://iscanner.com/) that do an excellent job of removing curvature and adjusting the brightness of photos, but the problem is that the post-processing stage is too slow for large quantities of pages.

The project uses openCV, ...

Algorithms currently implemented to remove page curvature:
- A
- B

Eventually, it would be nice to use this in a GUI.
